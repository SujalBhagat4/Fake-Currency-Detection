Fake Currency Detection using CNN

This project detects fake and genuine currency notes using a Convolutional Neural Network and provides a web-based interface for prediction.

Project Overview
Fake currency circulation is a serious economic issue. This system uses deep learning techniques to classify currency notes as real or fake based on image input.
